# Movies-Recommendation-System
Machine Learning Model can recommend movies to users by entering a movie name, and the model will present the entered movie and the closest movies to the entered movie.

You can check out the CSV file to see the data, and the Machine learning model to see how we clean, pre-possessing, split it to test/train, and model it at the end.

If you have any questions about the model, please feel free to contact me at: Omarhussin018@gmail.com

Thanks, and good luck with your coding journey.
